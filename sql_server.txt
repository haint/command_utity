###USING CURSOR

Step 1: Declare variables to hold the output from the cursor.


DECLARE @BusinessEntityID as INT;
DECLARE @BusinessName as NVARCHAR(50);

Step 2: Declare the cursor object;

	
DECLARE @BusinessCursor as CURSOR;

Step 3: Assign the query to the cursor.

	
SET @BusinessCursor = CURSOR FOR
SELECT BusinessEntityID, Name
 FROM Sales.Store;

Step 4: Open the cursor.

	
OPEN @BusinessCursor;

Step 5: Fetch the first row.

	
FETCH NEXT FROM @BusinessCursor INTO @BusinessEntityID, @BusinessName;

Step 5: Loop until there are no more results.  In the loop print out the ID and the name from the result set and fetch the net row.

	
WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0
BEGIN
 PRINT cast(@BusinessEntityID as VARCHAR (50)) + ' ' + @BusinessName;
 FETCH NEXT FROM @BusinessCursor INTO @BusinessEntityID, @BusinessName;
END

Step 6: Close the cursor.

	
CLOSE @BusinessCursor;

Step 7: Deallocate the cursor to free up any memory or open result sets.

	
DEALLOCATE @BusinessCursor;

Now putting it all together:
	
DECLARE @BusinessEntityID as INT;
DECLARE @BusinessName as NVARCHAR(50);
 
DECLARE @BusinessCursor as CURSOR;
 
SET @BusinessCursor = CURSOR FOR
SELECT BusinessEntityID, Name
 FROM Sales.Store;
 
OPEN @BusinessCursor;
FETCH NEXT FROM @BusinessCursor INTO @BusinessEntityID, @BusinessName;
 
WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0
BEGIN
 PRINT cast(@BusinessEntityID as VARCHAR (50)) + ' ' + @BusinessName;
 FETCH NEXT FROM @BusinessCursor INTO @BusinessEntityID, @BusinessName;
END
 
CLOSE @BusinessCursor;
DEALLOCATE @BusinessCursor;
